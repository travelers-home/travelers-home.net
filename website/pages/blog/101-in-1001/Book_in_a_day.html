Yesterday I finished reading one book in one day, in fact it was more like one book in four hours. I got my book Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in the mail, and after dinner I started reading, I will not give a summary of the book as I do not want to give any spoilers. 
What I will say is that I enjoyed it, it is definitely different reading a script vs a book, which is not unfamiliar to me, but obviously hadnâ€™t done that in the Harry Potter universe. It is meant to be seen as a play, but it was highly enjoyable to me. It is very different from the previous books, however I enjoyed every second. I probably should have paced myself a bit more so I could enjoy the new story over days vs hours, although as I have said before it is supposed to be seen as a play which takes place in a matter of hours instead of days as well.
For any Potter fan this book is well worth your time. And I hope one day I might be able to see the play, but for now that is a far off dream.

The cause I will be supporting as I mark off another one of my goals will be Extra Life.
