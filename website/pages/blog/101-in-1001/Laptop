I forgot to blog about this, but I guess it’s kinda hard to figure out exactly what to write... I bought a laptop, it was on my list. I guess the main reason for me wanting this is because I get too easily distracted on my pc to do any writing, or anything productive really... I suppose the nice thing about having two screens is to much of a luxury for an easily distracted mind. 
The other reason why I really wanted it was because we have a library system going on in our house, and to catlog books and games without getting distracted or forgetful is a lot easier when you have a computer next to the place where they enter the house, and where they are stored. Also for people checking stuff out of our library is easier to do without having to leave the room. And yes we are that weird that we have a whole computer program set up for this and it includes library cards.
